	\brief	This class is an expansion of the struct tm.

	\details	TimeRepresentation is an extention of struct tm. However, since the TimeRepresentation
				is calendar-independent, all fields in its struct are disjointed from Gregorian calendar.
				As such, tm_year is NOT years since 1900, but the year itself. The tm_mon is not the
				months since January, but number of the month in current year (for Gregorian calendar,
				January is 1st month, and December is 12th, but Gregorian calendar is not the only option).
